<!--       <h3>Machine Learning is hot now... but most important questions are causal</h3>-->
        <p>
           "Machine Learning" is "hot" now, especially due to the successful application of deep neural networks in tasks of computer vision, natural language processing, and game playing. 
        </p>
       
       <p>
           But these tools are still essencially about <i>curve fitting</i>, and most questions scientists are trying to answer are <i>causal.</i> Deep Learning cannot tell you whether cigarette smoking causes lung cancer based on observational data only, no matter how big your data, and no matter how deep your neural network.

            1. Sensitivity analysis tools for the most popular "identification strategies"
        </h4>

        <p>
            Current empirical research that aims to identify causal effects uses a small subset of "identification strategies", namely:
        </p>
        
    
        <ul>
        
            <li>
            Confounding Adjustment
            </li>
            
            <li>
            Instrumental Variables
            </li>
            
            <li>
            Differences-in-Differences
            </li>
            
            <li>
            Discontinuity Designs
            </li>
            
        </ul>
        
        <p>
        These "identification strategies" rely on several assumptions about the data generating processess, many of which are untestable from the data.
    
        I develop tools that help researchers and policy maker discipline the discussion regarding the validity of the conclusions of a study when these assumptions are called into question.
